# Artificial Neural Networks and Coronavirus - Data Insight 2

A recent data science development is the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict the occurrence of hotspots of COVID-19 within the United States.  Since COVID-19 is such a novel virus, researchers have been trying to discover where outbreaks may occur and also what factors lead people to be most susceptible to the virus.  In the past, ANNs have been used to help “model complex non-linear relationships in spatial epidemiology” (Mollalo et al., 2020, p. 2) and have even been used to detect asthma in spatial areas.  When combined with geographic information systems (GIS), the researchers were able to predict the prevalence of COVID-19 at the county-level in the US.

ANNs, also known as feed-forward neural networks, are a relatively new development in data science (.  Neural network processes are inspired by the brain.  In a process where information moves through multiple neuron layers of the network, with the middle layers being called “hidden layers,” the inputs are multiplied with a weight that corresponds to a connection to a specific neuron and within subsequent layers, the neurons correspond to a bias and an activation function.  The error is processed and the biases and weights within the network are adjusted to become more accurate, taking the learning rate and momentum of the network into account.  Then the output is compared after the inner layers processed and found patterns in the information (Mollalo et al., 2020).  Through this process of iterating through the inputs and calculating the errors associated with given weights and biases within the network, it is able to learn different relationships between possible inputs and outputs.  Due to the learning, the relationship can then later be used.  It is important to note though that ANNs do not use back-loops and are only feed-forward (Pratik, 2020).  This is why the values of the weights are adjusted.

Overall, the complex processes of a neural network can be described as a method of developing a relationship between inputs and outputs through a process of finding patterns and complex relationships in the data.  Different random weights and biases become more accurate over time as iterations are continued and the network is trained and learns the connections in the training set.

Through this development of technology, the researchers were able to map 217 counties in the US that could be considered to be COVID-19 hotspots (Mollalo et al., 2020).  A variety of different variables were used as inputs, including the prevalence of conditions like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory diseases, median household income, and the percentage of males who were over 65 in the county.  These variables had already been determined to have an impact on increased risk of contracting and becoming seriously ill from the virus.  The outputs of the training data would likely be where there are already coronavirus hotspots so the relationship between the variables and the hotspots could be learned.

Having the ability to predict and map coronavirus hotspots has significant importance to human development.  If the US were able to accurately identify areas at a county level that are especially at risk of outbreaks, these counties could impose more strict regulations to prevent further outbreaks and prevent spreads to other counties.  This is especially important now that the normal flu season is beginning.  If ANNs could be trained for other variables, perhaps the number of students participating in in-person classes, or the number of businesses that are opened, governments could have more data to support their decisions to either loosen restrictions or reinforce them.  

Returning to Amartya Sen’s definition of development, development is a measure of freedoms.  Coronavirus has caused many people to lose essential freedoms, not only freedoms of health.  The economy is suffering, people are losing access to education, work, relationships with people, and the freedom of transparency has constantly been threatened.  If more data can be collected and analyzed, not only about the virus, but about relationships with other living factors, some of these unfreedoms could be alleviated.  

While this application of ANNs was used back in the spring, meaning the actual findings of the researchers are now outdated since information about coronavirus is constantly changing, this just serves to reinforce the importance of ANNs.  Since they are able to quickly find patterns, people do not have to take the time to calculate these connections themselves.  Their ability to predict relationships without complete datasets is also an essential ability in this age of uncertainty regarding the virus and so many other factors of life.  This leaves more resources for people to focus on developing treatments or figuring out how to address problems in hotspots before they become uncontrollable, which there is a significant risk of now that cases seem to be increasing throughout the world.  As more information about the virus is discovered, the accuracy of the networks can also be improved as more specific and relevant variables can be inputted and new networks are trained.
