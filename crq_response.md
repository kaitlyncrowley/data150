# Central Research Question Reflection and Responses

My central research question is: What is the impact of data collection methods on the ability to accurately measure gender inequalities in Nepal and how can a frictionless path of data collection be implemented to improve these measurements?

My research question falls best into the category of exploratory research questions.  These questions try to figure out exactly what is happening in a particular area, and in the case of this question, this would be in the area of measuring gender inequalities.  It is clear already through the questions that the question of the impact of data science collection methods already leads to a question of how these methods can be improved to more accurately measure the inequalities faced by women.  This therefore fits the description of “generating questions for further research.”  In doing this activity, I think that my question could also fall into the category of evaluative questions due to the fact that one could be judging which data collection methods are best suited to solving the problem.  However, I think that focusing more on exploring the phenomenon of why measuring gender inequality can be so difficult and using this to begin exploring how to make this measurement more efficient, accurate, and descriptive would be the best way to direct my question.  Within the website provided, there is also another way of organizing research questions that is presented that provides a category I think my question fits into even more accurately.  This is the “causal/predictive puzzle.”  My question seeks to explore how the factor of data collection methods impacts the factor of gender inequality, specifically in Nepal.  It is clear from the second part of my question that this will lead to quantitate research because new methods, or different methods of data collection will need to be tested to see how to improve the measurements.  Overall, this categorization of question still seems to best fall into the category of “exploratory” questions because it is exploring how different methods of data collection could be implemented and it is exploring how these methods could then improve the accuracy of gender inequality measurements.

One possible sub-central research question is: How can data science methods be implemented to accurately measure the home environment of a woman and her level of autonomy within the home?  It is very difficult to quantify measures such as autonomy or individual home environments, yet it is these factors that are the greatest predictors of gender inequalities and serve to perpetuate or break the cycle of these inequalities.  Variables such as access to a school or health facility are somewhat easier to measure through mapping or general census data, but since this question is subject to more subjective evaluation, it is more difficult to accurately measure.  Another possible sub-question is: How are women marginalized from typical data collections?  By addressing this question, there is a possibility that current methods of data collection would not have to be changed as much, but rather who the data is collected on would be shifted.  From my research, it was found that it is often more difficult to collect data about women, but also, even if data could be collected, the method of collection meant that the data could not be disaggregated by sex.  This almost leads into a third sub-CDR, which could be: How can data collection methods like CDRs be improved to more accurately differentiate between genders?  CDRs are a more frictionless pathway for data collection than methods such as a census, so it would address the second part of the central research question.  If there could be a way to implement this method in a way where gender can be differentiated, this could greatly increase the accuracy of measurements of gender inequality.  However, at this point, women are often marginalized in CRD data or there is just no differentiation between genders
