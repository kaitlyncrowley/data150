Introduction

Gender inequality is a significant source of unfreedoms for women throughout the world.  These inequalities span back into the history of almost every culture, where women were placed in a subordinate position to that of men.  Even in more advanced countries, traditional patriarchal norms persist, leaving women in a significantly disadvantaged position.  These inequalities extend from the home, to school, to the workplace, and into healthcare.  Women are often expected to remain at home and care for the family and, in many countries, girls are forced into an early marriage because it is believed that marriage and caring for a family is her sole purpose.  This often means that the girl drops out of school and remains dependent on her husband, also isolating her from opportunities to participate in the economy, politics, or her community.  In fulfilling what many in traditional societies see to be as a woman’s primary role, many females actually lack access to effective prenatal and maternal care.  They not only lack this care, but also the ability to learn how to maximize that care and best raise their children since they often do not complete their education.  

Nepal is a primary example of a country where gender inequality persists, often in extremes.  The continuation of traditional views of women is one of the primary reasons for the persistence of inequality.  The extremely patriarchal societal structure and high levels of poverty throughout the country combine with traditional views to put women in a place of disadvantage that is more severe than in many other countries throughout the world (Bosco et al., 2019).  23% of people in Nepal live in extreme poverty, so this further complicates inequalities in the country since so many people are solely focused on survival, therefore not having the resources to gather support for a movement toward equality (Bosco et al., 2019).  In addition, and not as much money is utilized to create more accurate ways to collect data about the population.

In attempts to measure and collect data on these inequalities, new geospatial data science techniques are slowly being introduced and added to more traditional methods of data collection.  The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) is a popular survey that can be applied within countries.  In Nepal, it is called the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS).  The survey measures various “health indicators, including access to health services, some health behaviors, and health outcomes” (Aryal et al., 2019,  p. 5).  Bayesian geostatistical models can then be used to predict and fill in gaps in the data, creating high resolution mapping.  The Bayesian geostatistical models, in tandem with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), map inequalities at a more local scale in order to better reach individual women and individualize aid.  This is particularly important due to the fact that the NDHS method of survey collection method publishes the data on a larger, regional scale, which does not take into account the inevitable variations that can occur within the issue of gender inequality in individual villages or areas.


Maternal Health Care

Maternal health care is a primary factor in the inequalities faced by women around the world, but specifically in Nepal.  It is especially interesting to analyze maternal health since, in so many societies, motherhood is defined as one of the primary roles of women.  However, if women are in such an unequal position that even the right to have children safely is denied to them, this highlights the severe inequalities that exist within the societies.  In Nepal, there are about 287,000 maternal deaths per year, resulting from complications both during pregnancy and during childbirth (Adhikari, 2016, p. 1).  When compared to other countries, even in South Asia, this is a particularly high statistic.  258 women die for every 100,000 live births each year in Nepal, which is “higher than its South Asian neighbors such as India (174), Bhutan (148), Bangladesh (176), Myanmar (178), Pakistan (178), and Sri Lanka (30)”  (Aryal et al., 2019, p. 1).  

There are many factors that contribute to this large number of deaths, but the patriarchal values of the society are a common influence.  A study completed by Namasivayam et al. (2012) found that when a woman had a husband with more than one wife, the chances of her being able to access health care decreased substantially, specifically the chances of her delivering her child in a health institution.  This is essential in understanding gender inequality.  While polygamy is often accepted in many societies, it demonstrates a clear belief that women are, in a way, disposable, or do not have the same level of autonomy as men, who can have as many partners as they please.  The fact that, within this inequality, women are then subjected to lower levels of care allows one to see that there is a double standard, not only when it comes to the relationship between a husband and his wife or wives, but also in the way that the members of the relationship are valued.  

It is also important to note that poor maternal health care is not only detrimental to the mother.  The health of her children is also significantly affected.  When mothers are undernourished, exposed to domestic violence, or they live in a society where female infanticide is practiced, child mortality increased significantly (Brinda, 2015).  Since this inequality impacts children as well, it is even more essential that the issue is addressed.  It is a source of significant unfreedom for these children to be subjected to harm solely because of their mother’s position in society.  Especially for girls, this then leads to their increased subordination as they grow older.

Access to contraceptives is another one of the reasons that gender inequalities persist in Nepal in relation to maternal health.  Although the use of contraceptives has been increasing, as of the census in 2011, only 43% of women had access to contraceptives (Adhikari, 2016).  Traditional societies often stand for the idea that men control relationships and women do not have control over their bodies.  This often leads to them having more children than they may want.  Studies have shown that as women have more children in Nepal, they become less likely to access maternal health care (Namasivayam et al., 2012)  Taking away control over one’s own health is a significant denial of freedoms, specifically in social opportunities.  When women had autonomy in their relationships, researchers found that 36% used maternal health services, but when the women did not have autonomy in their relationship, only 24.5 % accessed maternal health services (Adhikari, 2016, p. 5).


Early Marriage

When a girl is made to marry early, her future prospects are significantly diminished, especially in Nepal.  Studies have shown that 40% of women in Nepal are married before they turn 18 (Jafarey et al., 2020).  Due to the patriarchal norms of society in Nepal, the husband controls the relationship, and getting married so young, the women have not had the time to develop their own ideas and identity fully before they are subjected to the will of their husband.  This therefore limits their overall freedoms to make decisions for themselves, often in the area of childbirth and care.

In the traditional society that drives many decisions in Nepal, early marriage often has a strong correlation with early pregnancy, meaning many of the women having children in Nepal are very young.  Adolescent pregnancy, women having children between the ages of 15 and 19, is a significant problem within Nepal (Neal, 2019).  Not only did 40% have their first child before the age of 20, but 5% had their first child before the age of 16 (Neal, 2019).  In getting married so young, it is inevitable that girls have to make sacrifices in their lives.  This includes their physical health, their educational opportunities, and their financial opportunities.  In addition, children of adolescent mothers experience that these opportunities are often threatened (Neal, 2019).  It is important to take into account that it is a cultural norm to have women marry young in Nepal.  However this has significant, often negative, implications, not only for her health, but also for her education.  


Female Education

Education is another theme relating to the concept of gender inequality.  It is clear throughout the world that, in general, females are more likely to be denied access to education than males.  Education provides a path for people, not only to get a job and support themselves, but also to have financial literacy and health literacy, and pass this knowledge on to their children.  Not having access to this path is one of the most severe forms of gender inequality that a woman can experience.  

In Nepal, there are significant inequalities in the access that girls have to education.  In a study in rural Nepal, it was found that only 39% of women completed secondary schooling, while 62% of men completed secondary schooling (Bosco et al., 2019).  While the percentage of men who do not complete secondary schooling is still relatively high, the important point of analysis when looking at these statistics is that men in rural Nepal are 23% more likely to complete secondary schooling.  Looking at these statistics alone, the inequality is clear, but the reasons for this disparity are equally important.  

One of the reasons that girls have less access to education is that their parents feel there is less incentive to pay to send girls to school, partially because they see that there are less opportunities in the workforce for women and also because of cultural norms where boys are expected to take care of their parents and home in the future, while girls are married off (Khanal, 2018).  This demonstrates how boys are often given preference for schooling because their parents see the investment as having a greater return (Jafarey et al., 2020).  Although it is likely not the thought process of many families, this preference reduces girls to an economic proposition rather than people who deserve equal access to an education.  In a study measuring this inequality, researchers found that “parents spend as much as 20% less on girls [education] compared with boys” (Khanal, 2018, p. 16).  It is important to note that this spending can also reflect the quality of schooling that a girl is receiving, which is an essential factor that is often overlooked when measuring access to school (Graetz et al., 2020).  Part of the reason families are spending less could likely be due to the fact that the schools some girls are attending do not have as many resources or quality teachers, therefore costing less.  The private schools in Nepal are much better quality schools and often spend eight times the amount of money on supplies and teachers than government schools do.  It is these government schools where many girls end up attending if they are given access to education (Khanal, 2018).  This means that even if statistics portray that more girls are gaining access to schooling, this access is likely severely limited to government schools where their experience will still be significantly less enriching than that of many of the boys in the country.

Many girls in Nepal end up leaving school early, even if they did have access to schooling at one point, most often through primary education.  The most common years that girls end up dropping out of school are 7th and 8th grade, accounting for 42% of female drop-outs (Sekine & Hodgkin, 2017).  “Early marriage is the most common reason for leaving school” (p. 1) in Nepal, with married girls being ten times more likely to drop out of school than their peers who do not get married (Sekine & Hodgkin, 2017).  The patriarchal cultural norms in Nepal make it so that marriage is seen as the only option for girls to find a place in society, so their education is often sacrificed in favor of them finding a husband.  This pattern often continues because mothers with an education are more likely to send their own daughters to school as well, yet many mothers do not have an education, so their daughters are not as likely to have this value instilled in them (Khanal, 2018).  

Interestingly, it is not always the fact that a girl gets married that causes her to drop out of school.  In fact, 68.8% of girls ages 15-17 who do get married had already dropped out of school while 84.9% of the girls still in school were not married (Sekine & Hodgkin, 2017).  Through this, one can see that gender inequalities and patriarchal norms of marriage are not only a cause of girls getting less education, but the low levels of girls in school also perpetuates early marriage early motherhood.  Through these different pathways to dropout rates, the complexities of gender inequality in Nepal are further revealed.
Education is a precursor to many different kinds of freedoms.  Although education can be thought of as a social freedom, it is essential for the maintenance of political, economic, and other freedoms as well.  In cutting females off from education, or high quality education, societies are denying half of their population the right to live with these freedoms.  It is important to note that the quality of education is incredibly important when analyzing this phenomena because, although many more girls are gaining access to education in Nepal and around the world, this education is not always the same quality as the boys in their community, or on par with students in other parts of the world (Khanal, 2018).  When women are not given the proper tools, they will never gain equality because, as can be seen in societies around the world, when new ideas and perspectives are not brought to the table, traditional practices persist.  In many countries, especially Nepal, these traditional practices include the unequal status and treatment of women.

Both access to health care and education play an essential role in the human development topic of gender inequality.  Information about the levels of inequality in these areas clearly point to an overarching level of gender inequality.  When females are not given the same value and position in society, it becomes easy for a society to deny them access to quality health care and education.  However, this complex concept can also be thought of in the reverse.  When females are not given access to education and health care, it is all but impossible for them to create their own position in society.  It then becomes necessary to devise methods of collecting and measuring the data on these inequalities to be able to better address the complex nature of this issue of gender inequality, both in Nepal and around the world.


Geospatial Data Science Methods and Data Sets

Rapid advances in technology are now able to be applied to traditional methods of collecting data on gender inequalities throughout the world.  Traditional surveys are often the primary method of collecting data and the DHS system for data collection “has been a leader in collecting and providing cluster-randomized survey data on core development indicators” (Gething et al., 2015, p. 15).  The NDHS is this specific survey within Nepal.  The boundaries of measurement are often the same as census enumeration areas (Gething et al., 2015, p. 7).  Some of the important measures that the survey takes into account include fertility rates, maternal and child health, mortality rates, access to health services, and levels of nutrition.  These surveys are conducted on a more specific scale than general censuses, but there is still room for error since the data cannot be disaggregated past the primary district level.  Although researchers attempt to account for this error in large scale measurements through creating a survey group that is a representation of the larger population itself, this still means that not every household is taken into account (Gething et al., 2015).  For example, in the 2016 NDHS, “11,473 households from 383 clusters” (Aryal et al., 2019, p. 5) were sampled.  While this is a significant number of households, it only accounts for a small fraction of the 28 million people who live in Nepal.  Within Nepal, measures of maternal health care are specifically focused on in many NDHS measures.  These measures include access to prenatal care, births in health facilities, antenatal care, and access to postnatal care (Aryal et al., 2019).

While the data from the DHS surveys can be helpful in seeing various gender inequalities, Bayesian geostatistical models are able to map factors at an even more localized level by creating a high resolution description of any variable within the country.  It has been found that 5x5km resolution can be effective in measuring gender inequalities, but advances in measuring techniques are now allowing for higher spatial resolution at 100m or finer (Gething et al., 2015).  This method is a “formal approach to identifying and propagating uncertainty” Gething et al., 2015, p. xv), even taking into account the potential error from the displacement of NDHS data due to the need to protect the privacy of participants.  This uncertainty is fit into the model and taken into account through processes of inference and utilization of covariates such as population density.  Improved outputs of the data can then be predicted.  The top-down method means that more specific areas can be mapped with the predicted outputs.  For each segment on a map, these areas can be divided even further so that more detail can be seen and analyzed geospatially (Gething et al., 2015).  This is essential when analyzing NDHS data that is published at a larger scale than is necessary to address issues, such as gender inequality factors, that are much more localized and specific to smaller areas of the country (Neal, 2019).  

The more specific areas of mapping can be as small as 100x100m, meaning that specific areas can be focused on when giving aid or resources.  In the case of female access to health care, this could more accurately measure where health clinics are.  If data is analyzed on a larger scale, areas may say that there is access to maternal health care, yet more specific segments of the population actually live a large distance from health institutions or are not able to easily access these institutions.  The same idea can be applied to access to education.  Schools are a topic that is very specific to towns and smaller areas, so the ability to map these local levels of access can better allow for addressing unequal access in specific areas.  

Through these methods, imaging can be created to estimate gender inequality in terms of healthcare and education specifically.  The maps and images created are much higher resolution, allowing for effective analysis of the gender inequality indicators (Bosco et al., 2019).  The Bayesian method allows for inference of more detailed analysis and when there is a more detailed and comprehensive picture of specific inequalities, the issue can be more accurately addressed.  A drawback, however, is that when using Bayesian geostatistical models, the information that is input determines the accuracy of the later predictions that are made by the model, so it is important that the data collection methods are as accurate as possible and updated. 


Conclusion

Even more so than in many other countries, gender inequality continues to be a significant development issue in Nepal.  Not only does this level of inequality prevent women from exercising freedoms, including the ability to access healthcare and education, it is also a detriment to their communities.  It is essential that new methods of data collection and mapping are implemented to be able to create a more complete picture of the inequalities that exist throughout the country.

When using Bayesian Geostatistical Models, the data produced is only as accurate as the data that is put in.  The most recent NDHS is now almost 5 years old, so in constantly changing societies, this data quickly becomes out of date.  It is essential to have even faster methods of data collection, with as little resistance as possible, on these topics so that the analysis can be completed on more up-to-date data.  In addition, it is essential to analyze the data at a more local level because the final NDHS reports give the statistics on development issues, yet they do not actually explain why the results of the survey occur (Aryal et al., 2019).  Using survey data, it is nearly impossible to predict things such as quality of education or the environment the women are living in at home.  While statistics on the number of women attending school or accessing health care can be accessed, the reasons behind these trends are often not feasible to predict.  When researchers are able to see more specific relationships between the data and areas where inequalities occur, the specific conditions and traditions of that area can be taken into account.  As a result, that area can be addressed more directly because the problems become more than statistics and can relate more to the individuals in the area who need to be helped.  When researchers are able to combine these abilities to collect data in real time and map them accurately with high resolution, many human development issues can be better addressed.


Reflection

To date, my research has developed into a definitive question about how to improve data collection methods on the topic of gender equality.  This human development topic is complex, especially in countries such as Nepal, since the inequalities that women face impact almost every aspect of their lives.  While it is possible to measure some of these inequalities, such as access to maternal health care or education, the nuances of these factors are often nearly impossible to measure using current methods.  For example, it is difficult to create methods that account for the quality of a girl’s education since it is often subjective.  Not only do the types of data collected need to be improved, but the data collection techniques severely limit the accuracy of the data.  As I further my research, I want to look into methods of data collection that allow for a direct, continuous flow of data to be accessible to researchers, instead of the census and survey data that is only collected every few years and does not always take the whole population into account.  

In my initial research, where I was completing my annotated bibliography, I found that new methods of data collection are being implemented in the field of gender inequality, such as Call Detail Records (CDRs), Subscriber-Identification Module cards (SIM cards), and even analysis of Facebook data.  However, much of this data is difficult to disaggregate according to gender and, as of right now, it is most applicable to gender movement and migration.  It would be interesting to see if these new collection methods could be changed, or if the data could be input into a data science model to predict a wider variety of indicators of gender inequality.  Since these methods are related to cellular devices and the internet, the data has the ability to constantly change and update without all of the complexities of surveys and censuses.  Any new methods of data collection would aid the process of measuring the gender inequalities in Nepal and globally since it is not a system that is moving toward equilibrium.  So many factors relate to the issue that they vary between countries, regions, and even villages, meaning the issue is evolving to become ever more complex as time goes on.  Having collection methods that can keep up with these complexities is essential.

The literature on the topic of gender inequality all points to a gap in the ability to actually collect accurate, up-to-date data on women, especially in more impoverished regions of the world.  Within the context of gender inequality in Nepal, a central research question that needs to be addressed is: What is the impact of data collection methods on the ability to accurately measure gender inequalities in Nepal and how can a frictionless path of data collection be implemented to improve these measurements?  By addressing this question, more accurate data on the inequalities faced by women can be collected, therefore increasing the accuracy of maps and other resources created to aid researchers in addressing the inequalities.

Overall, data science has the ability to help us further understand the many complexities of human development.  By creating numerical, tangible data to analyze, complex cultural and development processes can be measured in a way that wasn’t possible before.  Although methods of data collection and analysis need to continue to be developed, having the ability to, for example, look at a high resolution map of literacy rates in a developing country then allows for researchers and aid groups to target certain areas specifically to aid them in the development process.  

Without these methods, it is easy to make assumptions about certain development issues and where they occur in the world.  However, as Hans Rosling emphasized, the data collected often debunks our preconceived ideas about the levels of development around the world.  It is essential that we have the ability to debunk these myths about areas of development because not only do they create unfounded stereotypes, but they also mean that the energy directed towards solving development issues is not distributed effectively.

Complexity plays an essential role in this understanding.  In order to understand human development, as Owen Barder argues, people must recognize that development issues are not one dimensional.  It is not enough to just reform the social system of a country to address gender inequalities or other development issues.  These solutions must take into consideration the economic factors, the cultural factors, and the political environment of the country in addition to the social influences on development.  It is only through recognizing each of these individual aspects of human development that a solution, or maybe even a series of solutions, can begin to be developed.  Through data science, all of these variables and effects are more likely to be taken into account.  When each variable is measured and weighed against the others, more efficient and effective solutions can be created.  

Even with the many advances throughout the world in terms of human development, there are still significant violations of freedom throughout the world.  Although Amartya Sen’s definition of development is simpler than that of Barder, the concept of people needing to have access to freedoms remains essential even in the midst of more complex ideas of development.  Data science now helps researchers to take these freedoms into account along the way to figuring out the complex patterns and processes that accompany development as a whole.  We are now able to map, visualize, and compute levels of inequality throughout the world at a level that never would have been possible without ever-evolving data science techniques.  These advances are all the more important as society continues to change at a rapid rate and the world’s population continues to climb, especially in developing countries where development issues are the most severe.
