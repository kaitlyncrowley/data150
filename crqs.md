# Central and Sub-Research Questions

What is the impact of data collection methods on the ability to accurately measure gender inequalities and how can a frictionless path of data collection be implemented to improve these measurements?

1.	What current methods of data collection are being used to measure gender inequalities and why are these methods not adequate?
2.	How are women negatively affected by the lack of methods to accurately measure their place in society and levels of inequality?
3.	Why are women so often marginalized when it comes to current methods of data collection and how can these factors be addressed?
4.	How can newer methods of data collection such as CDR data be implemented in the areas of gender inequality while still disaggregating by sex and not solely focusing on migration patterns?
5.	How can Bayesian theory be applied to new methods of data collection to further improve the ability to map and address gender inequalities?
