# Barder Responses - 10/15

How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen's definitiion to include the idea of complexity?

Owen Barder extends Amartya Sen’s definition of development by claiming that development must be thought as of a “characteristic of the economic, social, and policitical system” .  In this sense, it can’t just be the individual people within a system.  Instead, the development must be a gradual process of increasing productivity, increasing incomes, and an expanding availability of opportunities for people in terms of choices and their freedoms.  This extended definition introduces the idea that development is not just about freedoms and unfreedoms of an individual, but rather a product of a series of changes and processes of an entire system.  Using this definition is increasingly complex because it takes so many more people and places into account for the reasons for changes in the developmental process.
One of his central claims was that development emerges from a system that adapts to the needs of people within it.  Now, not only are people affected individually by changes in development, but they are a part of a developing society.

question 2. Who was Thomas Thwaites and what was his "toaster project"?  Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of Barder's talk about complexity and development?
Thomas Thwaites was a design student who decided that he wanted to make his own toaster completely from scratch.  He wanted to be the one involved in the entire process from start to finish.  He bought a toaster to use as a guide, but then continued in his efforts to obtain raw materials and form them into some form of a toaster.  He was able to complete the project, but it caught fire after only a few seconds of being used.  
This points to the idea that development, in this case the development of the toaster, cannot be done by just one person or institution.  Real toasters are made of complex parts that involve different people and companies provide the different parts and materials necessary to develop a working toaster.
In the same way, development within society is a complex process.  One person does not have the ability to control all aspects of development in their area of society.  They must be helped by economic institutions, legal institutions, and political institutions.  Overall, the inclusion of the toaster example emphasizes the fact that it is not enough for people to assume that development can be completed by one person.  That one person, like Thwaites and the toaster, does not have enough knowledge and experience to fully participate in the advances necessary for complete development on their own.  

question 3.  Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010. Why was this example instructive as part of his talk?  What did this comparison demonstrate when used as the basis to validate (or invalidate) economic models?
The comparison of South Korea and Ghana illustrated the fact that technical change is often essential for development in addition to labor in an economy and the capital of the economy.  This reinforces the idea that development is a more complex process than just the access to wealth or goods.  
When being used to invalidate economic models, it was used because, before South Korea began to increase rapidly in terms of income, it was extremely similar to Ghana, meaning that the capital and access to labor were about the same in both countries.  This means that there had to be some sort of external factor from this that led to the ability for Korea to advance so much.  Barder argues that this reason is that South Korea had greater technical change than Ghana did.  Previous economic models focused on just capital, investments, and the labor available in a country, but this is not enough in the complex process of development.  Other factors can begin to take hold that lead to growth.  Countries like Ghana have not had the same growth of technology that countries like South Korea have had.  
However, it is important to note that technology is not the only factor in this difference since knowledge like that should be able to spread rapidly.  

Question 4.  What was the Harrod-Domar model? What are the two fundamental variables in this model? Who was Walter Rostow and what the impact of his work on development?  Was the Harrod-Domar model effective at predicting development outcomes? (edited) 

The Harrod-Domar growth model is a simple model that says that production relies on capital and labor.  According to this model, these are the only two main factors needed to increase the output of an economy.  Capital can be things like the tools to create a product, while the labor is the people actually available for the creation of certain goods and products.  
Walter Rostow was an economist who published a book titled “The Stages of Economic Growth.”  In this book, he claimed that the economy is a cycle.  It begins with increased investment.  When the investment in a country or economy increases, the capital of the economy and their stocks also increase, which leads to an increase or growth of economic outputs.  Due to this, incomes grow, people save more, and more investments can be made.  This work had a significant impact on development because it led to increased investment in countries of need.  Many countries began to invest in foreign countries.  People began to assume that if groups can predict the necessary amount of investment needed for a country, they can then have the ability to fill any gaps in the economy to make it more efficient.  
It is important to note that this should not be the only reason for aid to foreign countries, but for a period of time it was a central reason.
The Harrod-Domar model was not as effective at predicting development outcomes.  Going back to the previous question, this model was not able to explain the reason that South Korea and Ghana were so different in their growth since their capital and labor were so similar.  This model is often oversimplified since development is such a complex process.  It is unreasonable to believe that only two factors can be the reason that economic change occurs.

Question 5. What was the Robert Solow model and how did it address the limitations of the Harrod-Domar model? Was this model successful as predicting economic growth?

The Robert Solow model was a model that emphasized a third component to economic growth, “technical change.”  His model was known as the Neoclassical growth model.  This addressed the limitations of the Harrod-Domar model because it emphasized that labor and capital are not the only factors in economic growth and change.  However, this model was also limited because it doesn’t fully explain what the technical change is or where it ultimately comes from.  It was more successful in predicting economic growth, but it did not fully explain why that growth happens since “technical change” was never defined.  It is in this area of technical change where the difference in development can be explained.  In addition, knowledge, which is a large part of technical change, is easy to spread, so it would need to be assumed that it is not spreading or that the other components of the development, such as labor or capital are decreasing.
Question 6.  What was the Washington Consensus? How did it propose to improve upon models of economic growth?

The Washington Consensus was a grouping of reforms in policy to address the failures of previous models of economic growth.  The creators argued that government policy was the reason that some markets were not as successful and that these policies needed to be changed in order to improve growth.  In order improve models of economic growth, it proposed that government policies that interfered with markets would need to be changed because they were considered to be hindering the economy.
Overall, people think that this model is a failure because policy changes eventually did not cause impoverished countries to catch up with more industrialized countries.

Question 7. What was the Ajaokuta Steel Works? How did it illustrate the transition from a focus on policies to institutions.  How productive has the Nigerian steel works proven to be?

The Ajaokuta Steel Works was a huge investment in steel production.  It cost a significant amount of money.  However, it has not produced any steel.  This contradicts the idea that increased labor and capital should lead to economic growth.  Policies of investment and creation of new sources of capital clearly did not work in this case and it was mostly due to the fact that the institutions that ran the steel productions were corrupt.  
Overall the Nigerian steel works has not been productive.  In Nigeria, it is not an effective institution to have the steel work if management is not productive and if it is instead corrupt.  No matter how many policies are in place, corruption in institutions can be a hinderance to any attempt at economic growth.

Question 8. Who was Haile Sellasie?  What is the significance of Kapuscinski's book the Emperor? How did Ethiopia exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change? Do you agree with Barder's interpretation?

Haile Sellasie was an emperor of Ethiopia.  He was considered to be the only one to make decisions and ruled the feudal society of Ethiopia.  Kapuscinski’s book the emperor told about the last days of the emperor before he was overthrown in 1974.  Ethiopia exemplified the suppression of systemic change because all attempts to become a more inclusive society due to the fact that the rulers extracted all wealth and value from the economy to serve their own needs and desires.   Do agree with Barder’s interpretation because when people have so much power, it is almost inevitable that they will try to control the economy to sustain that power.  When all of this wealth is concentrated at the top, the people within the country are still stuck in situations of poverty.  No moves towards equality or positive change would result from leaders preventing change just to maintain their power.

Question 9.  Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at Uni-Lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results? (edited) 

Steve Jones, who is now famous in the study of evolutionary biology, originally worked in a soap factory.  He was asked to design a nosel for the creation of soap powder that was more efficient.  He developed a process where he tested 10 nozzels, took the most efficient one and then continued this process, only keeping the most efficient nosle from each test.  This illustrates the importance of nonlinear development.
He was incredibly successful and created a nozel that was exponentially more efficient than the original one.  This emphasizes the importance of adaptive change that can be the cause of rapid, significant improvements, not just small ones.

Question 10. What is the significance of Schumpeter's idea of creative destructive? How does it relate to firms and industries?

Schumpter’s idea of creative distruction is that as new ideas are created, they replace old ones, leading to a process of adaptation and evolution in industries and development.  As it relates to firms and industries, this is particularly important.  Firms and industries that are not as successful then fail to continue and can be replaced by more efficient and productive firms and industries.  These new industries are better adapted to the current environment, meaning tha they can better serve the needs of the people.  If old firms and industries continue, there will not be any progress in society.

Question 11.  Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? Does he suggest a different approach?  What did he mean by his use of the term, iso-morphic mimicry?

Barder recommended that we resist engineering because many changes in society have a non-linear nature.  If engineering were completed, all of the complex natures of different systems would not fully be taken into account.  Evolution often makes it so that a single solution cannot be engineered.  In terms of isomorphic mimicry, he was referring to the tendency to create an institution or policy that looks like an effective one, but that doesn’t actually work.  It is essential that the details of innovation are taken into account and not just things like he calls ‘institutional best practice’ which do not always work and are not able to effectively connect to the society and environments they are in.

Question 12. What did Barder mean by “resist fatalism”? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?

When he said to resist fatalism, Barder meant that we cannot just accept outcomes as they come.  Instead, we have the power to shape them and change them, even speeding up the process of development.  Norman Borlaug was a scientist that lead the Green Revolution where he began to crossbreed different varieties of wheat to make them more resistant to disease and make them yield more.  This revolution emulates resisting fatalism because he sped up the process of evolution to be able to solve the problems of lack of food.  Thousands of people were saved from starvation because he did not just accept outcomes of food production and instead made an effort to change it.
